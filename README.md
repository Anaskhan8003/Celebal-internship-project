Project Summary
In this project, we performed topic modeling on the mini_newsgroups dataset using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We:

Preprocessed the text using the GPT-2 tokenizer and applied Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to build a custom vocabulary.

Transformed documents into numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization.

Applied KMeans clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to group similar documents into topics.

Evaluated KMeans clustering using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI = 0.018) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI = 0.076).

Visualized the results using t-SNE plots and a heatmap comparing KMeans and LDA topic distributions.

This project showcases the use of advanced tokenization with classical topic modeling algorithms for understanding large text corpora.
